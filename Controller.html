            <h2>How to use game controllers in Windows 11</h2>
            <p>If you’re a console gamer looking to play PC games with a controller, you’re in luck! Your gaming controller should pair effortlessly with your Windows 11 PC. Learn how to play PC games with a controller and customize your controller to game your way.</p>
            <h3>How to connect your controller to your PC</h3>
            <p>Connecting a gaming controller to your Windows 11 computer couldn’t be easier. Whether your controller supports Bluetooth or not, we have you covered.</p>
            <h4>Connect a wired controller</h4>
            <p>If you’re using a wired controller, simply plug it into your PC via USB. Your PC should recognize your wired device right away and prompt you if an additional driver download is needed.</p>
            <h4>Connect a wireless controller</h4>
            <p>Many newer gaming controllers can be connected via Bluetooth. To connect this type of controller, follow these easy steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter Bluetooth into your Windows search bar and make sure Bluetooth discovery is enabled.</li>
                <li>Turn on your controller.</li>
                <li>Press and hold the Sync button on the top until the Guide button flashes.</li>
                <li>In the Bluetooth menu on your PC, select Add device and your computer will start looking for your controller.</li>
                <li>When it’s found, you can choose your controller from the results and then select Done to complete the setup.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If your controller is a little older, you may need a wireless adaptor, which you’ll insert into an available port on your PC. If the adapter features a sync button, press that before turning on and syncing your controller. From there, you should be able to add this device from your Bluetooth menu.</p>
            <h2>What games can I play on Windows 11?</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Select Windows + Q on your PC’s keyboard.</li>
